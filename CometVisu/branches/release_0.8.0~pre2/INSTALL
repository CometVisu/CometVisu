The installation of the CometVisu is very simple. You only need
to copy the directroy "release" on your web server and edit the
file "visu_config.xml" to match your local requirements.

Or if you want to see the unmodified (and thus unminimized) sources
and run those (e.g. debugging) you can copy the directroy "src"
onto you web server.
But then you should try the development version out of the SVN 
repository anyway.
