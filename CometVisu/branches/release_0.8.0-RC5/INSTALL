The installation of the CometVisu is very simple. You only need to follow a
few simple steps:

0. Install a web server and (optional but recomendet) PHP.

   When you use the WireGate, this is already done for you.
   
1. Install the backend, i.e. the dynamic interface to the web server that is
   connecting to the KNX bus.
   Detailed instructions are given on the web page at:
       http://cometvisu.de/wiki/index.php?title=CometVisu/Install_from_Source
  
   When you use the WireGate it should be already installed for you.
   
   When you use any other x86 based debian system, you can get the package
   out of the WireGate repository. It is contained in the package "eibd-clients"
   at http://repo.wiregate.de/wiregate/pool/main/e/
   
2. Copy the directroy "release" on your web server in the web root.
   
   When you use the WireGate, the directroy /var/www/visu_release/ might be
   a good choice; in the following steps it's assumed that this directroy is
   used.

3. Set write permissions on the config sub directroy for the web server, when
   you want to use the internal editor.

   When you use the WireGate, you could use this command:
   
       chmod -R a+w /var/www/visu_release/config
       
   It will give everyone write permissions - so it's probably too permissive
   for a shared server, but assuming the typical useage of the WireGate it
   should be fine.
