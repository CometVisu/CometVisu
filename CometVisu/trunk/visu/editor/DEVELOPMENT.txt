=== KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS ===
* loading the XSD is done in Javascript. The Schema-Loader knows a certain set an structure of an XSD. If "unknown"
  XSD-features are being used in the schema, the Schema-Loader may not know about them, and the editor will thus fail.
* the Schema and the Editor do not care about bounds. This means it does not check if the schema only allows
  for a certain number of children in an element.


=== ROADMAP ===
* MS1 - done
 - OOP-representation of the schema/XSD
 - OOP-representation of the configuration
 - validate configuration against XSD

* MS2 - week 46/47 2012
 - browser loads configuration, checks it against an XSD, warns if not compliant
 - editor is displayed in browser, nodes are shown as a tree
 - node-attributes can be edited
 - node children can be added, removed

* MS3 - week 49/50 2012
 - nodes have copy & paste, move.
 - configuration can be saved
 - attributes like rrd, addr can be selected from a list; said list is loaded from the server
 - attributes like styling, mapping can be selected from a dynamic list; list is based on actual configuration

* MS4 - week 52 2012
 - preview for a selected node without the need of replacing the configuration on the server


=== TODO ===
* MS1:
 - done

* MS2:
 - frontend: show tree
 - frontend: make node attributes editable
 - frontend: make node removeable
 - frontend: make node children addable, removable

* MS3:
 - frontend: have copy&paste for nodes incl. children
 - frontend: have move for nodes incl. children (drag&drop?; mind touch-devices!)
 - frontend: save configuration
 - backend (save the xml; php)
 - cross-reference: have select-lists for mapping, stylings, ... defined by the config itself

* MS4:
 - frontend: preview node incl. children
