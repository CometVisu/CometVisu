0.6.0-RC2
=========

- New Feature: Show version in status bar
- New Feature: toogle-widget (switch toggling multiple values based on mapping)
- New Feature: jqclock - a clock widget with statusbar-support
- infotrigger widget:
  - Show infoposition and format attribute in the editor
  - New Feature: also send absolute value change
- Add some missing links for DPT sub-types (incomplete; see Artifact 3424149)
- Feature Request #3113716: "Addresses should be shown"
- Fix Bug #3423019 and rendering problem in discreet_slim design
- Fix Bug #3424149
- Fix Bug #3370929: "Missing text in top line"
- Fix Bug #3204682: "Caching on web server"
- Fix Bug #3427309: "GA list unsorted in editor (transform_knx, get_adreesses)"
- Fix Usability: add a button movement "animation" to the triggers so that a 
  user has immediate feedback
- Whitespace clean up (DON'T USE TABS IN THE CODE!)

Config changes:
- As the infotrigger can send absolute values now and the distinguishing of the
  addesses for the relative mode based on the readonly attribute was unusual,
  the new version is using the variant attribute of the address element now.
  This will break backward compatability!

=====

  the structure of the config file had to change.

Config changes:
The format of the config file has changed. Please update the existing file, so:
- the labels are now sub elements of type <label>
- the addresses are now sub elements of type <address> with the attributes
  - src: the addess on the bus
  - transform (optional): the name of a function that translates between the
    raw values on the bus and the internal JavaScript types

    that address and not send values when the widget gets changed
