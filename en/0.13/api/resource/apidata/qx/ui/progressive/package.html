<p>This Progressive widget "renders" tasks progressively, i.e. it returns
 control to the browser periodically possibly allowing user interaction
 prior to completion of the full task..
 The concept "render" is used quite loosely, in that it could be building
 part of a GUI or it could be loading the next successive portion of a table,
 or it could be doing any partial task which requires periodically returning
 control to the browser to allow user interaction.
 This is a general purpose widget that happens to come packaged with some
 useful renderers:</p>
<ul>
<li>A progressive loader, that periodically shows the GUI state as more of
 the gui is being built;</li>
<li>A table renderer that produces a table very similar in appearance to
 qx.ui.table.Table but with a different set of features.  In particular,
 this table allows variable row height.</li>
</ul>
