<p>This namespace contains classes for the (automatic) migration of user
 code when the qooxdoo version changes in ways that require code changes.
 For each qooxdoo version that requires a change in user code, a Class
 is added to this namespace, the name of which is composed of a capital
 "M" and the version number with underscores replacing the periods
 (for example, version 6.0.0 -&gt; <code>qx.tool.migration.M6_0_0</code>).
 The class must extend <code>qx.tool.migration.BaseMigration</code>, which contains
 useful methods to manipulate source files, and to update runtime information
 on migration process. It also holds a reference to the runner instance which
 calls the individual classes and contains meta data for all migrations.
 The convention for the migration classes is that each migration step
 should be in a separate method, the name of which should clearly express
 what the method is doing. All migration method names must start with
 "migrate". For each migration step, either <code>this.markAsApplied()</code>
 or <code>this.markAsPending()</code> should be called to update the runner.</p>
