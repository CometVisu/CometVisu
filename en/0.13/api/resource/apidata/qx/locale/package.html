<p>This package provides support for internationalization (<em>I18N</em>) and
 localization (<em>L10N</em>).
 I18N is usually concerned with providing an application in multiple
 languages, i.e. a key point is to provide translations for user visible
 strings (labels, messages, help texts, …) and select the right set of
 strings for a given language.
 L10N is concerned with adapting the visual display of common units (calendar
 items like day and month names, date formatting, number formatting, keyboard
 key names, …) to regional preferences.
 There is a coupling between the two, hence <i>locale</i> names usually
 consist of a language part and a region part, as e.g. in <code>en_US</code>
 or <code>de_AT</code>. qooxdoo's locale system is oriented towards the
 Unicode.org <a href="http://cldr.unicode.org">CLDR</a> system, so both I18N
 and L10N data is organized according to locales.  That means selecting a
 certain locale in an application will try to pick a corresponding set of
 translations as well as regional settings.
 </p>
<h3> Translations </h3>
<p>The important step in providing multiple translations for an application is
 marking strings in the code for translation. This is easily done by wrapping
 those strings in one of several translation marker calls like {@link
 qx.locale.MTranslation#tr .tr()}. Those are available e.g. on each class that
 extends from {@link qx.ui.core.Widget Widget} or {@link
 qx.application.AbstractGui AbstractGui} (via {@link qx.locale.MTranslation
 MTranslation}), so you can use them on your application classes right away.
 </p>
<pre class='javascript'>
 var label = new qx.ui.basic.Label(this.tr("News * section"));
 </pre>
<p>In the simple case calls like <code>this.tr()</code> above will return the
 translation of the argument according to the currently selected locale if
 available. If the <code>qx.dynlocale</code> {@link qx.core.Environment
 Environment} setting has value <em>true</em> such calls will return an instance of
 {@link qx.locale.LocalizedString LocalizedString} instead. LocalizedString
 behaves like a string in many situations, but allows switching to yet another
 locale at a later time (normal strings are fixed once returned from the
<em>this.tr()</em> call).
 The {@link qx.locale.Manager Manager} class allows switching between locales.
 </p>
<h3> Localization </h3>
<p>The other classes in this namespace, like {@link qx.locale.Date Date}, {@link
 qx.locale.Key Key} or {@link qx.locale.Number Number}, encapsulate regional
 preferences for formatting and other properties with regard to such data.
