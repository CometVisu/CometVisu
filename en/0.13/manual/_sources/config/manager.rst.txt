The CometVisu Manager
=====================

The manager uses a simple graphical interface to manage (create,
edit, replace, delete) various configuration files.
In addition you can manage the :ref:`hidden configurations <hidden-config>`
as well as media files (for example backdrops).

.. hint::
    The manager can be opened by pressing the keys "Ctrl+M" together in a running CometVisu
    or by adding the url parameter `manager=1` to the CometVisu URL.

The available functions are accessible via menus, toolbars or buttons. The main page of the manager
is composed of the following components (from top to bottom):

* Menubar for general functions.
* Tab-bar to show the currently opened files.
* Tab-bar to change the view between a table-based and an preview-based display of the available files.
* A list of configuration files with an own tab-bar for special functions.
* A list of demo configuration files (has to be expanded by clicking on the title).
* A list of media files (if available)
* Special functions, like the hidden-configuration of an overview of all icons.


Available CometVisu Configurations
----------------------------------

Shows all available configurations files, split into the editable "normal" configurations files and
the non-editable demo configurations. Below every configuration there is a list of buttons that provide
a quick access to the most commonly used functions. You can download, view or edit the file with these buttons.
Additional functions are accessible by a contextmenu that can be opened with a click on the right mouse button
or a click on the 2nd button below each file.
