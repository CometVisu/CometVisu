Settings
--------

For a general understanding of how the configuration files are structured and what elements and attributes are
it is recommended to read this section first: :ref:`visu-config-details`.

The behaviour and appearance of the Image widget can be influenced by using certain attributes and elements.
The following tables show the allowed attributes and elements and their possible values.
The screenshots show, how both can be edited in the :ref:`editor <editor>`.

Attributes underlined by ..... are mandatory, all the others are optional and be omitted.

Allowed attributes in the Image-element
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. parameter-information:: image

Valid values for ``cachecontrol`` are:

``full``   Standard. By extending the URL with a timestamp a refresh is
           ensured. Server support is required though.
``force``  Using sophisticated methods an enfocrement of the refresh is
           attempted.
``weak``   The URL will be extended by an anchor with timestamp. This will
           work with most servers where ``full`` mode doesn't work. But it
           requires the correct use of HTTP headers by the server as well
           as a correct reaction by the web browser.
``none``   The URL will not be modified. A working refresh can be prevented
           by caching.
