<h3> CometVisu Plugin system <h3>     The CometVisu can load plugins in two different ways.     <h4>1. As part of the main code repository<h4>   These plugins are split into the main plugin source code, which is placed   in "sourceclasscvplugins" and the optional other data needed by the plugin to run. like   CSS-files, images, other libraries. Those files are placed in the resources subfolder   "sourceresourcesplugins<name-of-the-plugin>"     This is the preferred way to go if you want to add your plugin to the main repository later.     <h4>2. As external file<h4>   You can place a javascript source code file in "sourceresourcespluginsmy-pluginindex.js"   and load it by adding <code><plugin name="my-plugin"><code> to your config file.
