<h3> CometVisu Plugin system </h3>
<p>The CometVisu can load plugins in two different ways.
 </p>
<h4>1. As part of the main code repository</h4>
<p>These plugins are split into the main plugin source code, which is placed
 in "source/class/cv/plugins" and the optional other data needed by the plugin to run. like
 CSS-files, images, other libraries. Those files are placed in the resources subfolder
 "source/resources/plugins/<name-of-the-plugin>/"
 This is the preferred way to go if you want to add your plugin to the main repository later.
 </p>
<h4>2. As external file</h4>
<p>You can place a javascript source code file in "source/resources/plugins/my-plugin/index.js"
 and load it by adding <code>&lt;plugin name="my-plugin"/&gt;</code> to your config file.</p>
