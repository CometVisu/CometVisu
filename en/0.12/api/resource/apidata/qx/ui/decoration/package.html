<p>Decorations are used to style widgets. The idea is to have an independent
 layer around the widget content that can be freely styled. This way you can
 have separate decorators that define all kinds of decoration (colors,
 background image, corners, …), and apply them to existing widgets, without
 interfering with the widget code itself.
 Here is a schematic drawing to illustrate that:

    | | | &lt;div&gt;, &lt;input&gt;, &lt;image&gt;, ...      | |
