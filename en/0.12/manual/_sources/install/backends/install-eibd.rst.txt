Install knxd
---------------------

Due to the development deadlock at eibd the fork knxd was formed.
knxd is a KNX router that runs on all Linux computers and can
communicate with all known KNX interfaces.
The knxd must be compiled from the source code. A
configuration and compilation manual for debian Server can
be found on the `knxd github page <https://github.com/knxd/knxd>` __.
