Includes other configuration snippets. Note that this is no widget shown in your visualization it just gives
you the opportunity to split you configuration into multiple files. If you have a large configuration file
splitting it up might help to keep track of your configuration.
The path to the included files must be relative to the root folder (the one with the index.html).

**Example**

.. code-block:: xml

    <page>
     <include src="config/part1.xml"/>
     <include src="config/part2.xml"/>
    </page>

For a general understanding of how the configuration files are structured and what elements and attributes are
it is recommended to read this section first: :ref:`visu-config-details`.

The behaviour and appearance of the Include widget can be influenced by using certain attributes and elements.
The following tables show the allowed attributes and elements and their possible values.
The screenshots show, how both can be edited in the :ref:`editor <editor>`.

Attributes underlined by ..... are mandatory, all the others are optional and can be omitted.
