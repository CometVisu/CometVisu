Main Changes

v0.14.6
> Minor code tidy, no functional changes
> Added source map for minified version

v0.14.5
> All gauges will now accept the canvas parameter as both an ID string as before, and now also as a canvas object.

v0.14.4
> Some white space tidying, and yet another attempt to make the WindDirection gauge show 000 for 0 rather than 360!

v0.14.3
> Updated a number of Canvas drawing routines that were using an 'illegal' .clip() call with a parameter.
  These were throwing exceptions in FireFox version 21+

v0.14.2
> Updated the minimised version
> LinearBargraph
  * Added missing fix for scale issues when the minValue is non-zero in horizontal gauges

v0.14.1
> RadialBargraph, LinearBargraph
  * Fixed scale issues when the minValue is non-zero
> Radial, RadialBargraph, RadialVertical, Linear, LinearBargraph
  * Fixed default threshold value to be mid-scale when minValue is non-zero

v0.14.0
> Radial, RadialBargraph, RadialVertical, Linear
  * Added initialisation parameter thresholdRising [def: true], to change the threshold from the default rising
    alert to a falling alert.
  * Added method setThresholdRising(bool)
> Radial, RadialBargraph
  * Added methods to set the threshold and user LED visibility: .setLedVisible(bool), .setUserLedVisible(bool)
> RadialVertical, Linear, LinearBargraph
 * Added method to set the threshold LED visibility: .setLedVisible(bool)

v0.13.0
> Radial, RadialBargraph
  * Added an additional "user" LED...
    Initialisation parameters: userLedColor, userLedVisible [def: false]
    Additional methods: .setUserLedColor(), .toggleUserLed(), .setUserLedOnOff(), .blinkUserLed()
> RadialBargraph
  * Fixed trend indicator display bug
> Radial, RadialBargraph, RadialVertical, Level, Compass, WindDirection,
> Horizon, Led, Clock, StopWatch, Altimeter
  * Removed default 'size' value, now if no 'size' value is passed, the gauges take their size from the canvas. This
    makes it easy to specify the gauge size from the HTML or CSS. Takes: size = min(width, height)
> Linear, LinearBargraph, DisplaySingle, DisplayMulti,
> TrafficLight, Lightbulb
  * Removed default 'width' & 'height', if no values are passed, the gauges take these values from the canvas. This
    makes it easy to specify the gauge size from the HTML or CSS.
> Battery
  * Removed default 'size' value, now if no 'size' value is passed, the gauge takes its size from the canvas. This
    makes it easy to specify the gauge size from the HTML or CSS. Takes: size = canvas.width
> Odometer
  * Removed default 'height' value, now if no 'height' value is passed, the gauge takes its height from the canvas. This
    makes it easy to specify the gauge size from the HTML or CSS.
> WindDirection, Compass
  * Added degreeScaleHalf:true|[false] parameter, this changes the gauge from using 0 -> 360 to -180 -> +180,
    useful for apparent wind.
  * Added pointSymbolsVisible:[true]|false parameter, useful for apparent wind, points must be hidden to show negative
    degree values when using degreeScaleHalf
> DisplaySingle, DisplayMulti
  * Added headerString:'text' and headerStringVisible:true|[false] parameters, puts some static header text on
    the display panel above the value.
> DisplayMulti
  * Added detailString:'text' and detailStringVisible:true|[false] parameters, adds a prefix string to the 'oldValue'
  * Added linkAltValue:[true]|false parameter, optionally unlinks the 'altValue' so it can be set independently
  * Added altValue:<value> parameter and setAltValue() method to set the alternative (minor) value when linkAltValue = false
> Level, Compass
  * Added rotateFace:true|[false] parameter, when set the indicator is fixed and the dial face rotates.
> VerticalRadial
  * Added steelseries.Orientation.EAST option
> Tween
  * fixed bug in .playing()

v0.12.1
> Radial, RadialBargraph, RadialVertical, Linear, LinearBargraph, WindDirection
  * Added initialisation parameter 'fullScaleDeflectionTime' default 2.5 seconds
  * Change deflection time to be a proportion of fullScaleDeflectionTime, with a minimum value of fullScaleDeflectionTime/5
> WindDirection
  * Fixed cut'n'paste error in setValueAnimatedAverage to affected value=360

v0.12.0
> Linear & LinearBargraph
  * Fixed bug that stopped min/max/threshold indicators displaying correctly on gauges with
    scales that did not have a minimum value of zero.
> All Gauges
  * Added ability for all 'set' methods to be chained. So for example you can now use code like...
    gauge.setMinValue(5).setMaxValue(25).setValue(10);

v0.11.15
> * Added playAlarm() to all setValueAnimated() methods where it was missing.

v0.11.14
> * Added parseFloat value checks to set() and setAnimated() methods

v0.11.13
> DisplaySingle
  * Added configuation parameter alwaysScroll [false]|true
> WindDirection

v0.11.12
> General
  * Removed all remaining 'shadow' drawing code, now relying on native browser capabilities.

v0.11.11
> Radial & RadialVertical
  * Simplified the pointer shadow drawing - note shadows do not display correctly in the
    Chrome browser because of a bug http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=90001

  * Fixed 360 degree value handling (sort-of!)
> General
  * Added lots of missing buffer resets to most gauges

v0.11.4

    - odometerParams: pass a set of parameters in an object to over-ride the defaults. The height parameter will be ignored. Default={}
    - odometerUseValue: if true display the current gauge 'value' in the odometer, otherwise the odometer
      value is set independently. Default=false
