Settings
--------

For a general understanding of how the configuration files are structured and what elements and attributes are
it is recommended to read this section first: :ref:`visu-config-details`.

The behaviour and appearance of the Page widget can be influenced by using certain attributes and elements.
The following tables show the allowed attributes and elements and their possible values.
The screenshots show, how both can be edited in the :ref:`editor <editor>`.

Attributes underlined by ..... are mandatory, all the others are optional and be omitted.

Allowed attributes in the Page-element
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. parameter-information:: page

.. widget-example::
    :editor: attributes
    :scale: 75
    :align: center

    <caption>Attributes in the editor (simple view) [#f1]_</caption>
    <page name="Testpage">
        <layout colspan="4" />
        <text><label>Test</label></text>
    </page>

2D pages
^^^^^^^^

At 2D pages it is possible to freely position the widgets on the page as well
as use a background image. A typical use case is a floor plan as backdrop
where in each room the relevant widgets are positioned accordingly.

Background image
................

The size of the background in relation to the browser window is controlled
by the attribute ``size``. The following holds:

.. figure:: _static/size.svg
    :alt: size attribute

| The attribute ``backdropalign`` can move the position of the background
  image. By default it is centered, which is the same as a value of ``50% 50%``.
| Setting ``0px 50%`` would place it on the left side but vertical centered and
  ``0px 0px`` would place it on the left and top of the page.

Widgets
.......

For the widgets it is important to set the ``x`` and ``y`` attributes of its
``layout`` element. These values must have a CSS unit. Typical would be a
value like ``12%`` for a relative position and ``123px`` for an absolute
position in pixel.

.. tip::

    To figure out the optimal value for the position it is possible to use
    the development mode of the modern browsers: this mode is activated by
    pressing :kbd:`ctrl` + :kbd:`shift` + :kbd:`i`.

    First the widget must be roughly positioned in the config file, then this
    config must be opened in the browser where the development mode must be
    activated. Then the "box with cursor" must be clicked followed by a click
    on the widget of interest in the browser window itself. This widget is now
    shown in the DOM tree. Probably it is necessary to go a few levels up there
    so that in the end the line with ``<div class="widget ...`` is selected.
    There you can see at the ``style`` attribute the values set in the config
    file for ``left`` and ``top``.
    These values can be changed now (most easily in the right part of the
    window in the "styles" section). These changes are immediately shown in the
    browser window. The determined value must then be transferred to the config
    file to make them persistent.

        :alt: development mode

Allowed child-elements and their attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All widgets are allowed in the page widget.

Examples
--------

It is possible to manually edit the :ref:`visu_config.xml <xml-format>` and add an entry
for the Page widget.

.. CAUTION::
    Make sure that you only use UTF-8 encoded characters by settings the encoding in your
    XML-editor to UTF-8 mode!
