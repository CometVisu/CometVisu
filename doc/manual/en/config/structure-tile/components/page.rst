.. _tile-component-page:

Page
....

The page-component is the main content element of the tile structure. Only one page is visible at a time.
Within the page, any widgets can be displayed, and a page can also contain other pages.

The arrangement of the widgets is automatic. The available space is filled from left to right and from top to bottom.
The number of widgets per row depends on the screen width. On mobile phones, no more than two widgets fit in a row.

In addition, there is the possibility to group widgets. These :ref:`groups <tile-component-group>`. Each group
has a title and the content of the group can be hidden.
