The CometVisu is a package that contains two important parts.

One is the CometVisu Client, a JavaScript file that establishes the
communication to a Backend on a server that talks the CometVisu Protocoll.
This file might be used on its own together with a custom visualisation.

The other part is the CometVisu Visualisation. It is a template engine
that creates an easy to use, web based visualisation. All the necessary
configuration is done in a simple XML file.

*** Important note on diagram-backend ***
It uses a modified version of rrdtool, adding a "fetchj" option.
