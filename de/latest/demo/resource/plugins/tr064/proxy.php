/**
 * This little PHP helper will fetch the page that the GET parameter "uri"
 * points to and pass it directly to the browser.
 *
 * This is a needed workaround for two reasons:
 * 1. A Fritz!Box only allows the device (IP address) to access an SID that
 *    recieved it by authentication.
 * 2. When the browser want's to authenticate itself it would need to know
 *    the credentials, i.e. they must be accessable in the same way as the
 *    CometVisu config file - something that should be prevented already in a
 *    medium secure environment.
 * 3. A Fritz!Box uses a self signed SSL certificate that created annoying
 *    messages on the client side.
 *
 * Security considerations:
 * A pure proxy script could create security problems by itself. To prevent
 * a misuse this proxy will only access the configured TR-064 device.
 * So the GET parameter "device" must be included in the file
 * "/config/hidden.php" and the URI will be matched against it.
